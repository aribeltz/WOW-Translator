# WOW Translator

This is a simple "translator" that is designed to mimic the in-game behavior of communicating via different in-game languages. It is not truly "translating" anything, it is instead picking from pre-set words based on the length of a passed in string.

## Language Resources

I used the following sites to compile the translation options:

[Draconic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic)
