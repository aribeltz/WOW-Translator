# WOW Translator

This is a simple "translator" that is designed to mimic the in-game behavior of communicating via different in-game languages. It is not truly "translating" anything, it is instead picking from pre-set words based on the length of a passed in string.

## Language Resources

I used the following sites to compile the translation options:

[Draconic](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic)

[Darnassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Darnassian)

[Dwarven](<https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarven_(language)>)

[Draenei](<https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenei_(language)>)

[Thalassian](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Thalassian)

[Gnomish](<https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Gnomish_(language)>)

## Planned Additions

- Add the ability to create and manage a dictionary of your own per language.
- Add a check for repeated words, to improve the randomized sentences.
- Add the ability to handle phrases.
